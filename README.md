# Welcome to DBsheetscript!
These autoplayers are not only limited to DB. They are also suitable for use with other virtual instruments that utilizes the QWERTY keyboard, however your sheets are required to be created in a certain format to be read (refer to existing autoplayer sheets).

## Autoplayers for DB
**1. ahkautoplayer_ml3czus.ahk** 

Our latest autoplayer with more advanced options + selectable sheets on the spot. More likely to run slower if your PC is slow.
    
**2. autohotkey.ahk**

Old autoplayer built with sticks and stones. Still works just fine with a much simpler interface and generally runs faster. May not be compatible with AHK v2.0.

> [!NOTE]
> Your PC's performance will affect how fast the autoplayer runs
