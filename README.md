# Autoplayers for DB
These autoplayers are not limited to DB. They are also suitable for use with other virtual instruments that utilizes the QWERTY keyboard, however your sheets are required to be created in a certain format to be read (refer to existing autoplayer sheets).

✨ Credits to ml3czus for sharing their autoplayer ✨
