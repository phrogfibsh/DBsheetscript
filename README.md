recommended to use the first autohotkey script, autohotkey v2.0 is actually just a bandaid solution for some users who weren't able to use the first script. 
autohotkey v2.0 uses a different type of input and may perform slower.



the third script is not for desert bus 

! **your pc's performance will affect how fast the autoplayer runs** !
